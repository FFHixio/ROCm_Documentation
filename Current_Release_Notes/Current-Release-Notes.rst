What's New in This Release
==========================

Hipfort-Interface for GPU Kernel Libraries
------------------------------------------

Hipfort is an interface library for accessing GPU Kernels. It provides support to the AMD ROCm architecture from within the Fortran programming
language. Currently, the gfortran and HIP-Clang compilers support hipfort. Note, the gfortran compiler belongs to the GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC). While hipfc wrapper calls hipcc for the non-fortran kernel source, gfortran is used for FORTRAN applications that call GPU
kernels.

The hipfort interface library is meant for Fortran developers with a focus on gfortran users.

For information on HIPFort installation and examples, see

https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipfort


Error Correcting Code Fields in ROCm Data Center Tool
-----------------------------------------------------

The ROCm Data Center (RDC) tool is enhanced to provide counters to track correctable and uncorrectable errors. While a single bit per word error
can be corrected, double bit per word errors cannot be corrected.

The RDC tool now helps monitor and protect undetected memory data corruption. If the system is using ECC- enabled memory, the ROCm Data
Center tool can report the error counters to monitor the status of the memory.

Static Linking Libraries
------------------------

The underlying libraries of AMD ROCm are dynamic and are called shared objects (.so) in Linux. The AMD ROCm v3.8 release includes the
capability to build static ROCm libraries and link to the applications statically. CMake target files enable linking an application statically
to ROCm libraries and each component exports the required dependencies for linking. The static libraries are called Archives (.a) in Linux.

This release also comprises of the requisite changes required for all the components to work in a static environment. The components have been
successfully tested for basic functionalities like *rocminfo /rocm_bandwidth_test* and archives.

In the AMD ROCm v3.8 release, the following libraries support static linking:

Known Issues
============

ROCm Data Center Installation Issue on CentOS/RHEL 7.8/8.2 and SLES
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing ROCm Data Center on CentOS/RHEL v7.8/v8.2 and SLES may fail with an error.

This issue is under investigation and there is no known workaround currently.


Undefined Reference Issue in Statically Linked Libraries
--------------------------------------------------------

Libraries and applications statically linked using flags *-rtlib=compiler-rt*, such as rocBLAS, have an implicit dependency on
gcc_s not captured in their CMAKE configuration.

Client applications may require linking with an additional library *-lgcc_s* to resolve the undefined reference to symbol *"_Unwind_ResumeGCC_3.0"*.

MIGraphX Pooling Operation Fails for Some Models
------------------------------------------------

MIGraphX does not work for some models with pooling operations and the following error appears:

*˜test_gpu_ops_test FAILED"*

This issue is currently under investigation and there is no known workaround currently.

MIVisionX Installation Error on CentOS/RHEL8.2 and SLES 15
----------------------------------------------------------

Installing ROCm on MIVisionX results in the following error on CentOS/RHEL8.2 and SLES 15:

*"Problem: nothing provides opencv needed"*

As a workaround, install opencv before installing MIVisionX.

What's New in This Release
==========================

AOMP ENHANCEMENTS
-----------------

AOMP is a scripted build of LLVM. It supports OpenMP target offload on AMD GPUs. Since AOMP is a Clang/LLVM compiler, it also supports GPU offloading with HIP, CUDA, and OpenCL.

The following enhancements are made for AOMP in this release: 

•	OpenMP 5.0 is enabled by default. You can use -fopenmp-version=45 for OpenMP 4.5 compliance

•	Restructured to include the ROCm compiler

•	B=Bitcode search path using hip policy HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH and hip-devic-lib command line option to enable global_free for kmpc_impl_free

Restructured hostrpc, including:

•	Replaced hostcall register functions with handlePayload(service, payload). Note, handlPayload has a simple switch to call the correct service handler function.

•	Removed the WITH_HSA macro

•	Moved the hostrpc stubs and host fallback functions into a single library and the include file. This enables the stubs openmp cpp source instead of hip and reorganizes the directory openmp/libomptarget/hostrpc.

•	Moved hostrpc_invoke.cl to DeviceRTLs/amdgcn.

•	Generalized the vargs processing in printf to work for any vargs function to execute on the host, including a vargs function that uses a function pointer.

•	Reorganized files, added global_allocate and global_free.

•	Fixed llvm TypeID enum to match the current upstream llvm TypeID.

•	Moved strlen_max function inside the declare target #ifdef _DEVICE_GPU in hostrpc.cpp to resolve linker failure seen in pfspecifier_str smoke test.

•	Fixed AOMP_GIT_CHECK_BRANCH in aomp_common_vars to not block builds in Red Hat if the repository is on a specific commit hash.

•	Simplified and reduced the size of openmp host runtime.

•	Switched to default OpenMP 5.0

ROCm COMMUNICATIONS COLLECTIVE LIBRARY
--------------------------------------

Compatibility with NVIDIA Communications Collective Library v2.7 API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ROCm Communications Collective Library (RCCL) is now compatible with the NVIDIA Communications Collective Library (NCCL) v2.7 API.

RCCL (pronounced "Rickle") is a stand-alone library of standard collective communication routines for GPUs, implementing all-reduce, all-gather, reduce, broadcast, reduce-scatter, gather, scatter, and all-to-all. There is also initial support for direct GPU-to-GPU send and receive operations. It has been optimized to achieve high bandwidth on platforms using PCIe, xGMI as well as networking using InfiniBand Verbs or TCP/IP sockets. RCCL supports an arbitrary number of GPUs installed in a single node or multiple nodes, and can be used in either single- or multi-process (e.g., MPI) applications.
The collective operations are implemented using ring and tree algorithms and have been optimized for throughput and latency. For best performance, small operations can be either batched into larger operations or aggregated through the API.

For more information about RCCL APIs and compatibility with NCCL v2.7, see
https://rccl.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html


Singular Value Decomposition of Bi-diagonal Matrices
----------------------------------------------------

Rocsolver_bdsqr now computes the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of bi-diagonal matrices. It is an auxiliary function for the SVD of general matrices (function rocsolver_gesvd). 

BDSQR computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a n-by-n bidiagonal matrix B.

The SVD of B has the following form:
B = Ub * S * Vb'
where 
•	S is the n-by-n diagonal matrix of singular values of B
•	the columns of Ub are the left singular vectors of B
•	the columns of Vb are its right singular vectors

The computation of the singular vectors is optional; this function accepts input matrices U (of size nu-by-n) and V (of size n-by-nv) that are overwritten with U*Ub and Vb’*V. If nu = 0 no left vectors are computed; if nv = 0 no right vectors are computed.

Optionally, this function can also compute Ub’*C for a given n-by-nc input matrix C.

PARAMETERS

•	[in] handle: rocblas_handle.
•	[in] uplo: rocblas_fill.
Specifies whether B is upper or lower bidiagonal.

•	[in] n: rocblas_int. n >= 0.
The number of rows and columns of matrix B.

•	[in] nv: rocblas_int. nv >= 0.
The number of columns of matrix V.

•	[in] nu: rocblas_int. nu >= 0.
The number of rows of matrix U.

•	[in] nc: rocblas_int. nu >= 0.
The number of columns of matrix C.

•	[inout] D: pointer to real type. Array on the GPU of dimension n.
On entry, the diagonal elements of B. On exit, if info = 0, the singular values of B in decreasing order; if info > 0, the diagonal elements of a bidiagonal matrix orthogonally equivalent to B.

•	[inout] E: pointer to real type. Array on the GPU of dimension n-1.
On entry, the off-diagonal elements of B. On exit, if info > 0, the off-diagonal elements of a bidiagonal matrix orthogonally equivalent to B (if info = 0 this matrix converges to zero).

•	[inout] V: pointer to type. Array on the GPU of dimension ldv*nv.
On entry, the matrix V. On exit, it is overwritten with Vb’*V. (Not referenced if nv = 0).

•	[in] ldv: rocblas_int. ldv >= n if nv > 0, or ldv >=1 if nv = 0.
Specifies the leading dimension of V.

•	[inout] U: pointer to type. Array on the GPU of dimension ldu*n.
On entry, the matrix U. On exit, it is overwritten with U*Ub. (Not referenced if nu = 0).

•	[in] ldu: rocblas_int. ldu >= nu.
Specifies the leading dimension of U.

•	[inout] C: pointer to type. Array on the GPU of dimension ldc*nc.
On entry, the matrix C. On exit, it is overwritten with Ub’*C. (Not referenced if nc = 0).

•	[in] ldc: rocblas_int. ldc >= n if nc > 0, or ldc >=1 if nc = 0.

rocSPARSE_gemmi() Operations for Sparse Matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This enhancement provides a dense matrix sparse matrix multiplication using the CSR storage format.
rocsparse_gemmi multiplies the scalar αα with a dense m×km×k matrix AA and the sparse k×nk×n matrix BB defined in the CSR storage format, and adds the result to the dense m×nm×n matrix CC that is multiplied by the scalar ββ, such that

C:=α⋅op(A)⋅op(B)+β⋅CC:=α⋅op(A)⋅op(B)+β⋅C

with

op(A)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪A,AT,AH,if trans_A == rocsparse_operation_noneif trans_A == rocsparse_operation_transposeif trans_A == rocsparse_operation_conjugate_transposeop(A)={A,if trans_A == rocsparse_operation_noneAT,if trans_A == rocsparse_operation_transposeAH,if trans_A == rocsparse_operation_conjugate_transpose

and

op(B)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪B,BT,BH,if trans_B == rocsparse_operation_noneif trans_B == rocsparse_operation_transposeif trans_B == rocsparse_operation_conjugate_transposeop(B)={B,if trans_B == rocsparse_operation_noneBT,if trans_B == rocsparse_operation_transposeBH,if trans_B == rocsparse_operation_conjugate_transpose
Note: This function is non-blocking and executed asynchronously with the host. It may return before the actual computation has finished.

For more information and examples, see
https://rocsparse.readthedocs.io/en/master/usermanual.html#rocsparse-gemmi


Known Issues
============

The following are the known issues in this release.

(AOMP) '˜Undefined Hidden Symbol' Linker Error Causes Compilation Failure in HIP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HIP example device_lib fails to compile due to unreferenced symbols
with Link Time Optimization resulting in '˜undefined hidden symbol'
errors.

This issue is under investigation and there is no known workaround at
this time.

MIGraphX Fails for fp16 Datatype
--------------------------------

The MIGraphX functionality does not work for the fp16 datatype.

The following workaround is recommended:

Use the AMD ROCm v3.3 of MIGraphX

Or

Build MIGraphX v3.7 from the source using AMD ROCm v3.3

Missing Google Test Installation May Cause RCCL Unit Test Compilation Failure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users of the RCCL install.sh script may encounter an RCCL unit test
compilation error. It is recommended to use CMAKE directly instead of
install.sh to compile RCCL. Ensure Google Test 1.10+ is available in the
CMAKE search path.

As a workaround, use the latest RCCL from the GitHub development branch
at: https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl/pull/237

Issue with Peer-to-Peer Transfers
---------------------------------

Using peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers on systems without the hardware P2P
assistance may produce incorrect results.

Ensure the hardware supports peer-to-peer transfers and enable the
peer-to-peer setting in the hardware to resolve this issue.

Partial Loss of Tracing Events for Large Applications
-----------------------------------------------------

An internal tracing buffer allocation issue can cause a partial loss of
some tracing events for large applications.

As a workaround, rebuild the roctracer/rocprofiler libraries from the
GitHub ˜roc-3.7" branch at: 

https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/rocprofiler â€¢
https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/roctracer

GPU Kernel C++ Names Not Demangled
----------------------------------

GPU kernel C++ names in the profiling traces and stats produced by ‘—hsa-trace’ option are not demangled.
As a workaround, users may choose to demangle the GPU kernel C++ names as required.

As a workaround, users may choose to demangle the GPU kernel C++ names
as required.

‘rocprof’ option ‘--parallel-kernels’ Not Supported in This Release
----------------------------------------------------------------------

‘rocprof’ option ‘--parallel-kernels’ is available in the options list, however,  it is not fully validated and supported in this release.

Random Soft Hang Observed When Running ResNet-Based Models
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A random soft hang is observed when running ResNet-based models for a loop run of more than 25 to 30 hours.  The issue is observed on both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks.

You can terminate the unresponsive process to temporarily resolve the issue.

There is no known workaround at this time.
